## Goal

In this repository there will be architecture design of said project with diagram and explanations of each part of this microesvices architecture project

## Guidelines of this project

1. Microservices architecture and complimentary technologies used (kubernetes, cloud, on premise, message bus...)
2. OOP design patterns usage in architecture design step
3. Follow Clean code (book) prinicples
4. Test coverage above 90% - naming pattern MethodName_ShouldDoGet_WhenSomething

## Service file structure is

- ./ - service logic
- ./models
- ./controller
- ./otherServiceUsed - can be multiple
- ./otherServiceUsed/models
- ./otherServiceUsed/endpoints
